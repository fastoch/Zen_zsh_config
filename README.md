# Getting started

- make sure you have zsh installed on your system
- make it your main login shell via `chsh -s $(which zsh)`
- After changing your shell with `chsh`, log out and log back in
- make sure Git is installed
- backup any .zshrc you may already have via `mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak`
- create a brand new zsh config file via `touch ~/.zshrc`
- open this config file with your favorite text editor (which should be Vim)

# Plugin manager for zsh

The .zshrc file is where all of our zsh config is going to live.  
The first thing we're going to configure being a **plugin manager**
